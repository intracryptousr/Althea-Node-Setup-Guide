**1. Download the Althea chain and Gravity tools**.
```
cd ~
mkdir althea
mkdir althea-bin
cd althea-bin
wget https://github.com/althea-net/althea-chain/releases/download/v0.0.4/althea-0.0.3-4-g30eddc7-linux-amd64
mv althea-0.0.3-4-g30eddc7-linux-amd64 althea
wget https://github.com/althea-net/althea-chain/releases/download/v0.0.4/client
wget https://github.com/althea-net/althea-chain/releases/download/v0.0.4/orchestrator
wget https://github.com/althea-net/althea-chain/releases/download/v0.0.4/register-delegate-keys
wget https://github.com/althea-net/althea-chain/releases/download/v0.0.4/relayer
chmod +x *
sudo mv * /usr/bin/
```
**2. Create the keys**
Remember to *back up* the sentence you get!
> NOTE: 'nodesguru' is just your nickname (2nd command) and your key name (3rd command), you can choose any one you like. They can also be different.

```
cd ~/althea
althea init nodesguru --chain-id althea-testnet1v4
althea keys add nodesguru – that is the name of node
```

 ❗️ **Important: write generated mnemonic phrase in a safe place** 

 **3. Genesis**
Copy the genesis file with the following commands:
```
wget https://github.com/althea-net/althea-chain/releases/download/v0.0.4/althea-testnet1-v4-genesis.json
cp althea-testnet1-v4-genesis.json $HOME/.althea/config/genesis.json
```
Modify the configuration file ~/.althea/config/config.toml with vi or nano to include the following information:

Execute:
```
nano ~/.althea/config/config.toml
```
Find persistent_peers, replace with the next value:
```
persistent_peers = "05ded2f258ab158c5526eb53aa14d122367115a7@testnet1.althea.net:26656"
```
**4. Start Althea Node**
```
screen -S althea
althea start
```
Press Ctrl+A then D to detach screen
Check for Althea synchronization using:
```
althea status 2>&1 | jq .SyncInfo
```
 <img src="https://api.nodes.guru/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Althea-2.png" alt="Alt Text">

Once "catching_up" has become "false", you can proceed to the next steps (synchronisation can take up to 24 hours).
You can also check the current altitude [here](https://testnet.althea.aneka.io).

**5. Request some tokens**
Check your address:
```
althea keys list
```
Copy your address from the address field:
 <img src="https://api.nodes.guru/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Althea-3.png" alt="Alt Text">

 Sometimes the faucet does not work correctly. In this case, please request credentials using the #althea-validators channel on Althea discord.
 Check your balance:
 ```
althea query bank balances <address here>
```
 <img src="https://api.nodes.guru/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Althea-4.png" alt="Alt Text">
 
Send a validation device setup event. Set moniker=<yournodename> and from=<keyname> (take it from step 2):

```
althea tx staking create-validator \
--amount=10000000ualtg \
--pubkey=$(althea tendermint show-validator) \
--moniker="put your validator name here" \
--chain-id=althea-testnet1v5 \
--commission-rate="0.10" \
--commission-max-rate="0.20" \
--commission-max-change-rate="0.01" \
--min-self-delegation="1" \
--gas="auto" \
--gas-adjustment=1.5 \
--gas-prices="0.025ualtg" \
--from=myvalidatorkeyname
```
Enter your password and select 'y':
 <img src="https://api.nodes.guru/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Althea-5.png" alt="Alt Text">

 Confirm that you are validating. Enter the validator's key name:
 ```
althea query staking validator $(althea keys show <MYVALIDATORKEYNAME> --bech val --address)
```
 <img src="https://api.nodes.guru/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Althea-6.png" alt="Alt Text">

 **6. Set the gravity bridge**
You are now validating in the Althea blockchain. But as a validator, you must also use Gravity bridge components, or you will be cut and removed from the validator pool after about 16 hours.

Please modify your validator node configuration to enable RPC. In app.toml, set "enable" of api to true.

```
nano $HOME/.althea/config/app.toml
```

Here is an example of what it looks like:
 <img src="https://api.nodes.guru/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Althea-7.png" alt="Alt Text">

 Once you have done this, you will need to restart the validator.

 ```
screen -r althea
```

hit ctrl-c and then run

```
althea start
```
Press Ctrl+A and then D to disconnect the screen.

 **7. Register the authorised keys**

 When you record the sentence generated by this command, you will have two sentences to keep track of. Save THIS SENTENCE, you will need it later. The one created here is the "authorized address" and the one created earlier is the "validator address".
```
RUST_LOG=INFO register-delegate-keys --validator-phrase="the phrase you saved earlier" --cosmos-rpc="http://localhost:1317" --fees=footoken
```

**8. Fund the keys of the delegates**
Both your Ethereum delegate keys and your Cosmos delegate keys need some tokens to pay for gas. On the Althea chain side, you were sent some "footoken" with ALTG. In this test network, we mainly use footoken as a token to pay for gas.

You should have received 100 Althea Governance Tokens as uALTG and the same amount of footoken. We will send half to your authorized address.

To get the address of your validator key, you can run the command below, where 'myvalidatorkeyname' is the name you gave your key in the 'generate your key' step.

```
althea keys show myvalidatorkeyname
althea tx bank send myvalidatorkeyname <your delegate cosmos address> 50000000footoken --chain-id=althea-testnet1v5
```
**9. Download and install Geth Goerl from the test network.**
We use Geth Ethereum light clients for this task. For Production Gravity, we recommend that you point your Orchestrator to a Geth light client and then configure your light client to compare with the full nodes you manage. This provides greater reliability, as light clients start/stop and resynchronize very quickly. For example, you can rebuild an Ethereum node without days of downtime for Orchestrator.

Note that only Geth full nodes can serve Geth light clients, other node types are not allowed. You must also configure the Geth full node to serve requests from light clients, as they do not do so by default.

For this test network, just follow the instructions below, even on the slowest node the synchronization should happen in a few minutes.
```
wget https://gethstore.blob.core.windows.net/builds/geth-linux-amd64-1.10.1-c2d2f4ed.tar.gz
tar -xvf geth-linux-amd64-1.10.1-c2d2f4ed.tar.gz
cd geth-linux-amd64-1.10.1-c2d2f4ed
screen -S Goerlint 
./geth --syncmode "light" --goerli --http --cache 16
```
Press Ctrl+A then D to detach screen.

 **10. Start Orchestrator**
Now that the installation is complete, you can start Orchestrator. Use the Cosmos memory stick created in the 'register delegate keys' step and the Ethereum private key also created in that step. You should install Orchestrator in systemd or elsewhere so that it stays running and restarts when it crashes.

If your Orchestrator shuts down for more than 16 hours during the test network, you will be cut and removed from the active selector pool.

Since you use this frequently, I recommend putting a command in a script, like this:
```
nano start-orchestrator.sh
#!/bin/bash
RUST_LOG=INFO orchestrator \
--cosmos-phrase="your delegate key phrase" \
--ethereum-key="your delegate ethereum private key" \
--cosmos-legacy-rpc="http://localhost:1317" \
--cosmos-grpc="http://localhost:9090" \
--ethereum-rpc="http://localhost:8545" \
--fees=footoken \
--contract-address="0xB48095a68501bC157654d338ce86fdaEF4071B24"
screen -S Orchestrator
bash start-orchestrator.sh
```
Press Ctrl+A then D to detach screen.
```
screen -ls
```
